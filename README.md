# 🌍 Geodesic Distance Measurement Web App

An interactive web-based tool to calculate the **geodesic distance** between two user-selected points on a map. This project utilizes the **ArcGIS JavaScript API** and **GeometryEngine** to compute accurate distances by accounting for the curvature of the Earth.

## 🛠️ Features

- 🌐 Interactive world map interface
- 📍 Select two points by clicking on the map
- 📏 Calculates geodesic (shortest path on Earth) distance in kilometers
- 🔄 Real-time updates as points are selected
- 💡 Simple and intuitive UI for smooth user experience

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript (ES6)**
- **ArcGIS JavaScript API**
- **GeometryEngine**
